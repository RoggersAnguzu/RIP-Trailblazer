## Introduction

Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest routing protocols used in computer networks. It's a distance-vector routing protocol that helps routers in an IP network share information about the network's topology and select the best paths for forwarding packets.

This repository serves as a resource for understanding, implementing, and experimenting with RIP routing. It includes code examples, documentation, and references to relevant materials.

## Features

- **Distance-Vector Protocol**: RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol, which means it bases its routing decisions on the number of hops to reach a destination.

- **Easy to Implement**: RIP is relatively simple to implement, making it a useful learning tool for understanding routing protocols.

- **Split Horizon and Route Poisoning**: RIP employs techniques like split horizon and route poisoning to prevent routing loops.

- **Support for IPv4**: RIP is primarily used with IPv4 networks.

## Getting Started
**Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
 Please note that RIP is less commonly used in modern networks, and other routing protocols like OSPF and BGP are often preferred. However, RIP can be a valuable tool for learning about routing.
